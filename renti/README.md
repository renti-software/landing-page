## GitLab CI

This project's static Pages are built by [GitLab CI][ci], following the steps
defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml).

## Building locally

To work locally with this project, you'll have to follow the steps below:

1. Fork, clone or download this project
1. Install npm
1. Preview your project: `npm run start`
1. Add content

(This will only work when the React project is made available in the repository. For now, you can only preview the page locally running `serve -s build/`
